    "My opinion is that a data scientist should, at a minimum, grasp the main concepts of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and object association. Python OOP is a skill that I would personally like to test at interview time. So, how do we do that? Just like a picture is worth a thousand words, a program is worth a hundred questions. If one does a web search for OOP interview questions, the class design of a hotel’s reservation management system comes up often. So here is my test: Design the classes for a small hotel’s reservation management system (RMS), where you utilize the concept of encapsulation, and at least once the concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, and object association. The rest of this post depicts the solution of our little exercise."
