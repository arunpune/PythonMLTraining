This repository appears to be organized by topics in Python machine learning training:
- Starting with Python basics, OOP concepts, data manipulation using Numpy, Scipy, and Pandas,
- Data visualization,
- Approaches to linear regression and L1 regularization,
- Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests,
- Unsupervised learning with K-means,
- Customer behavior analytics,
- Web scraping with PySpark.

Each main directory likely contains code and notebooks relevant to the named subject, making the repo useful for structured, topic-wise machine learning education in Python.
